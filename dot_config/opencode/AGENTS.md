# Environment Rules
- **OS**: Windows (Git Bash). Use forward slashes `/` and `/c/` prefix for absolute paths.
- **Search**: `rg` and `fd` are installed. Use them for fast searching.

<use_fd>
You run in an environment where `fd` is available; whenever a search requires fast file searching, use `fd <pattern>` (or set additional flags as appropriate).
</use_fd>
